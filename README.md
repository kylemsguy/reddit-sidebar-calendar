#reddit-sidebar-calendar
A calendar for embedding into the sidebar of a subreddit

How to install:
  1. paste the contents of stylesheet.css into your subreddit's stylesheet
  2. paste the contents of sidebar.md into your subreddit's sidebar where you would like the calendar to be.
  3. edit the contents of the calendar as you see fit

How to format your calendar:
 - You may format each day and header with normal markdown
 - All hover text must be contained within a link text.
 - You may change which element is used as the container for the hover text in the CSS.

To generate your own calendar (requires Python 3.x):
 - Run the included sidebar_md_generator.py to generate your own calendar
 - Coming soon: add your own events from within sidebar_md_generator.py
